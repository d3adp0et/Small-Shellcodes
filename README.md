# Small-Shellcodes
ASAP (As Small As Possible) Shellcodes

A compilation of all the smallest shellcodes and some other types that I have developed for my CY5770 Software Vulnerabilities and Securities in-class CTFs

**Most of these shellcodes do the same job - invoke chmod syscall and change the flag file's 'other' (--o) permission to read (--r)**
